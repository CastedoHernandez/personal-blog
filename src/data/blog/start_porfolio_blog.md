description: First step in the process to build a porfolio with a blog together

Now I want to create a porfolio page that allow me to show what are the things that I am doing but more important will be to track the work that I am doing during the years. And have a nice view on my thought when I create different random things.


In this case is the portfolio plus a blog. I am not that focus in the frontend development so I ask friend chat gpt to tell me what is the different alternatives. And the results is:

- **Next.js (React + Node.js)**  
    ✅ Modern, fast, SEO-friendly  
    ✅ Easy to add a blog (Markdown or CMS)  
    ✅ Deployable for free (Vercel, Netlify)
    
- **Astro**  
    ✅ Super fast, supports Markdown out-of-the-box  
    ✅ Great for blogs + portfolios without much overhead
    
- **Hugo or Jekyll (Static Site Generators)**  
    ✅ Simple to set up, write blogs in Markdown  
    ✅ Free hosting on GitHub Pages

During the last times I was following an Spanish creator related to the software and he speak so good about Astro. As soon as I see that I thought okay, I am going with it. I want to try it and also the points that chat gpt makes looks attractive to me.

The decision has been made. We will see if at the end I finish the thing hating Astro and my own life. 

The next important question is how I am going to deploy this. Guess what i did, yesl, ask chat gpt and I have different alternatives for different technologies:

- **Vercel** → works best with Next.js, Astro.
- **Netlify** → good for Hugo/Jekyll.
- **GitHub Pages** → free, simple, but less flexible.

As I choose in the Astro to go with Vercer as a platform for the deployment. But, you can not believe but also I have been listen to many good things about Vercel and I am being follow this guys for a long time. But again, not time to use it. 

I just realize that all of this is not free, so I want to check the price before go forward but surprise they have a pricing level that is free. Perfect!!  I will go with Vercel.

So decisions has been made. Now I have to start working on it, the fun part I guess.
